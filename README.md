# cnn_analysis
Use Layer visualization and Occlusion to analyze a Convolutional Neural Network

## Layer Visualization
Only visualizing the first layer is practical, as it becomes difficult to interpret deeper hidden layers

## Occlusion
Used to determine which patches of the image contribute more to the output of a neural network
